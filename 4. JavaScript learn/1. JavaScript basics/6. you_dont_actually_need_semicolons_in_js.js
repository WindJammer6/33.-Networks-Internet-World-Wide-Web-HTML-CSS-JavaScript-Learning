// As mentioned by the name of the file, you dont actually need semicolons ';' 
// for JavaScript. The code below works fine.
console.log('Hello, World');
console.log('Hello, World')


// But it is convention for you to put semicolon ';' at the end of every line of
// JavaScript code, though not compulsory.
