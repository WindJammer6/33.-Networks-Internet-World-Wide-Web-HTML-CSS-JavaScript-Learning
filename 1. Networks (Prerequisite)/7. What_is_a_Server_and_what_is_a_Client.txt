What is a Server?
A Server is a computer that awaits requests (data) from a Client. It processes that request (data) (somehow
via some program), and then sends that processed request (data) as a response back to the Client.

What is a Client?
A Client is a computer that sends requests (data) to a Server. After the Server processes their request (data),
the Client will receive it from the Server.

(Note: 
- What is a computer?
  A computer is a machine/device that can be programmed to automatically carry out sequences of arithmetic 
  or logical operations (computation). This allows it to store, manipulate, and process data according to 
  a set of instructions
