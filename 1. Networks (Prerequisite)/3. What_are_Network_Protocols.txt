What are Network Protocols?
Network Protocols are a set of rules that are responsible for the communication of data between various 
devices in the network. These protocols define guidelines and conventions for transmitting and receiving 
data, ensuring efficient and reliable data communication.

Each layer in the OSI layer model is actually referring to a packet of network protocols. You can
see which network protocols belong to which layer in the same diagram of the OSI layer model here.

Due to the very large number of protocols in the OSI model, I will only be going in depth on 
6 of the more common protocols (from different layers of the OSI model):
1. TCP/IP vs UDP/IP (Transport Layer) (see the '4. What_are_TCP_UDP_IP_protocols.txt' file)
2. DNS (Application Layer) (see the '5. What_is_DNS_protocol.txt' file)
3. HTTP/HTTPS (Application Layer) (see the '6. What_is_HTTP_HTTPS_protocols.txt' file)
