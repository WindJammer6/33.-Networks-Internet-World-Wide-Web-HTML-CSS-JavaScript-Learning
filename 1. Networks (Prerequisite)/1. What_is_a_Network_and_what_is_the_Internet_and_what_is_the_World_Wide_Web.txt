Why when learning about HTML, CSS and Javascript, I need to know about Networks, the Internet and 
the World Wide Web?
Since HTML, CSS and JavaScript are programming languages for the World Wide Web, its useful to understand how 
Networks, the Internet and the World Wide Web works.


/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////


What are Networks?
It is defined as the connection between 2 or more computers (somehow, either using wires/cables (Ethernet) or 
using radio waves (Wi-Fi)).

The 5 Types of Networks:
- PAN (Personal Area Network)
- LAN (Local Area Network)
- CAN (Campus Area Network)
- MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)
- WAN (Wide Area Network)

                   | PAN               | LAN              | CAN      | MAN               | WAN                  
Technology         | Bluetooth, Zigbee | Ethernet & Wi-Fi | Ethernet | FDDI, CDDI, ATM   | Leased Line, Dial-Up 
Range              | 1–100 m           | Up to 2 km       | 1–5 km   | 5–50 km           | Above 50 km          
Transmission Speed | Very High         | Very High        | High     | Average           | Low                  
Ownership          | Private           | Private          | Private  | Private or Public | Private or Public    
Maintenance        | Very Easy         | Easy             | Moderate | Difficult         | Very Difficult       
Cost               | Very Low          | Low              | Moderate | High              | Very High

(Note: 
- What is a computer?
  A computer is a machine/device that can be programmed to automatically carry out sequences of arithmetic 
  or logical operations (computation). This allows it to store, manipulate, and process data according to 
  a set of instructions
)




What is a (Data) Link?
A (data) link is a single connection between 2 computers (somehow, either using wires/cables (Ethernet) or 
using radio waves (Wi-Fi)).

Hence a Network is made up of 1 or more (data) links.

What is the Internet?
As described by the CS50 professor, the Internet is a hardware thing, where there is a whole lot of servers out
there, that are somehow interconnected, via physical cables, internet service prociders, via wireless connectivity
and the like.

And once you have these networks of networks of networks (combination of PANs, LANs, CANs, MANs, WANs), you have 
the Internet.


Rough description of the Internet's origin
The Internet used to be something called the ARPAnet, from the Advanced Research Projects Agency, which is
intended to only interconnect a few Universities in Utah and California, USA, where servers/computers in each
University is somehow interconnected by wires so that people could share data. A year later, this interconnected
web expanded to include other Universities including MIT, Harvard and others.

Fast forward to today, you have a huge number of systems around the world that is on this same network, which is
new called the Internet.


Applications of the Internet
The Internet is kind of like the low level plumbing/architecture, which includes all of the network technology 
and physical cables, which allows more high level applications/services to be built on top of it.

Here are some of the more important applications/services that are built on top of the Internet:
- The World Wide Web
- Email

What is the World Wide Web (WWW)?
The World Wide Web (WWW or simply the Web) is an information system/service that enables content sharing over the 
Internet through user-friendly ways meant to appeal to users beyond IT specialists and hobbyists.

WWW is conceptually built on top of the Internet, where the Internet is sort of the low level plumbing/architecture, 
which includes all of the network technology and physical cables.
