What is Domain Name System (DNS) Protocol? (from the Application Layer)
Recall that each computer has its own unqiue IP address that identifies itself, which
looks something like this: 
    `192.168.1.10` 

(see the '2. What_is_the_OSI_layer_model.txt' file for more information on what 
each of the numbers mean under the Network Layer)

But as a human, and if you want to tell your computer to send a message to another
computer, its unlikely you will remember the other computer's IP address and shouldn't
care what that other computer's IP address is right?

Similar to the case where you might not remember the phone number of every single one
of your friends, you instead look them up in some way. So what is this way?

In your web browser, when you look for a website, you typically don't search something
like this: `192.168.1.10`. What do you typically type in a web browser to look for
a webiste?


If you guessed a domain name, then you'll be right! You will typically look for something
like 'Stanford.edu', 'Harvard.edu', 'gmail.com' etc.! So these are domain names!

You can imagine the DNS being an external server connected to your computer via a wireless
or wirelessly that stores a big hash table or phonebook that looks something like this which
its whole purpose is to translate domain names to IP addresses, specifically, it translates
Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDN) to IP addresses:

     FQDN     |                     IP address Range(s)
 harvard.edu  | 128.103.0.0/16, 140.247.0.0/16, 65.112.0.0/20, 67.134.204.0/22                                                                                                                                                       |                                                                                           |
 stanford.edu | 128.12.0.0/16, 171.64.0.0/14, 204.63.224.0/21                                                                                                                                                                        |                                                                                           |
 gmail.com    | 64.233.160.0/19, 66.102.0.0/20, 66.249.80.0/20, 72.14.192.0/18, 74.125.0.0/16, 
              | 108.177.8.0/21, 108.177.96.0/19, 172.217.0.0/19, 173.194.0.0/16, 207.126.144.0/20, 
              | 209.85.128.0/17, 216.58.192.0/19, 216.239.32.0/19
              



Difference between Domain Names and Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDN)
The main difference is that the domain name is used to identify a website while FQDN is used to 
identify a specific computer or server on the Internet.

A domain name refers to a zone/namespace, representing an organization or websit, while a FQDN 
is a complete name pointing to a specific host (computer/server) inside the domain.

Multiple computers can share the same domain name, but each one will have its own FQDN.
 FQDN                     | Role           
 `www.harvard.edu`         | Main web server
 `mail.harvard.edu`        | Email server   
 `cs.harvard.edu`          | Computer science department site
 `vpn.harvard.edu`         | VPN server     
 `student1.cs.harvard.edu` | Studentâ€™s personal machine or lab server
