What is Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)? (from the Application Layer)
It is a protocol that standardizes how Clients (a computer) and Servers 
(a computer) intercommunicate data (e.g. images, videos, audios, documents, etc.)

It is a TCP/IP based protocol.

Recall in the TCP/IP based protocol (see the '4. What_are_TCP_UDP_IP_protocols.txt' file),
transfer of information, aka the 'virtual information envelope'. So HTTP defines what type
of information goes into these envelopes at the Application Layer (apart from the IP addresses, 
Port number and Sequence number which gets added at the Transport Layer)

For HTTP to work, the Client and Server computer must both be communicating
via HTTP.




There are 3 important functionalities of HTTP:
1. HTTP is connectionless: after making the request, the Client disconnect from the Server,
   then when the response is ready the Server re-establish the connection again and deliver the response
2. The HTTP can deliver any sort of data, as long as the two computers are able to read it.
3. The HTTP is a stateless: The Client and Server know about each other just during the current 
   request, if it closes, and the 2 computers want to connect again, they need to provide information 
   to each other anew, and the connection is handled as the very first one.




The Request-Response Cycle:
Using an example of this with the World Wide Web, 


             o                                The Internet                          |------------|
            /|\  _|   ----------------------------------------------------------    | Web Server |
            / \                                                                     |------------|
    [web browser (Client)]

(www.example.com/prodicts/myproduct.html)

lets say you have a web browser (Client) and a web Server. A Client wants to see a website,
e.g. www.example.com/prodicts/myproduct.html, and hence the Client types in the URL of the website
using the Client program, typically a web browser, but first the web browser (Client) and the web Server
needs to be physically connected.

This is the job of the Internet, which establishes that connection using a combination of media to prepare
the session/connection for the 2 computers to communicate via the HTTP protocol (see how this is done via
the OSI model in the '2. What_is_the_OSI_layer_model,txt' file).

1. Once this session/connection is established, the Client then can send a Request (in the form of a 
   HTTP message) to the Server. Because HTTP is connectionless, after doing so it disconnects from the 
   Server waiting for the Response (in the form of a HTTP message).
2. The Server then processes the Request (in the form of a HTTP message), prepares the Response via some 
   program, re-establishes the another session/connection, and sends back the Response (in the form of a 
   HTTP message).


(Note: 
 What is a Uniform Resource Locator (URL)?
 It is known as the address of a resource on the Internet, but it is most commonly used in the World 
 Wide Web. 

 For example (an example of a full URL),
        https://www.example.com/folder/file.html?id=5&lang=en#section2

 It is broken down into different parts which provides different information about the address:
 - Communication Protocol (Application Layer) used (i.e. https): The Communication Protocol (Application Layer) used 
   (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, FTP)

 - Full Domain name (i.e. 'www.example.com'):
   => Domain name: Tells you the organisation that runs the resource (e.g. www.amazon.com, 
      www.facebook.com, etc.)

   => Subdomain (i.e. 'www'): it is just a prefix added to a domain name to help organize or separate parts of a 
      organisation's resources/website/service. For example, Google uses subdomains to organise their 
      resources/website/service, such as 'translate.google.com', 'assistant.google.com', 'play.google.com'.

      The 'www' is just a subdomain name that stands for the World Wide Web, and is traditionally used
      to represent the main resources/website/service. But it’s not required and is treated just like any other 
      subdomain.

   => Top-level domain (i.e. '.com'): It indicates the type, purpose or geographical location of a domain.
      For example,
      + '.com' stands for commercial
      + '.edu' stands for educational institutions
      + '.fr', '.sg', '.uk' stands for France, Singapore and United Kingdom respectively (country-owned)
      + etc.

 - File path (i.e. '/folder/file.html'): which directs the resources/website/service to a specific page/file 
   within

 - Port number (optional)	(i.e. :443) (though already implied in HTTPS): Port on the Server to connect to
   (default is 80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS)
 
 - Query parameters	(optional) (i.e. ?id=5&lang=en): Extra arguments sent to the Server, often used in dynamic 
   web browsers (Client)
 
 - Fragment	(optional) (i.e. #section2): Refers to a specific section within the resource (used by the web 
   browser (Client))
)




How does a HTTP message look like?
A typical HTTP message looks like this, consisting of 3 main sections:
Typical HTTP message
        +-----------------------------+
        |        Start line           |
        +-----------------------------+
        |          Headers            |
        +-----------------------------+
        |           Body              |
        +-----------------------------+


All 3 main sections contain plain text based information (the Body might contain binary data).

The contents of a HTTP message differs for a Request HTTP message or Response HTTP message:
Request HTTP message
        +------------------------------------------------+
        | Method   path/to/file.ext (URI)   HTTP/version |    Start line 
        +------------------------------------------------+
        | Name1: value1                                  |    Headers
        | Name2: value2                                  |
        | Name3: value3                                  |
        | ...                                            |
        +------------------------------------------------+
        | E.g. some content (optional body)              |    Body
        +------------------------------------------------+

E.g.
        +-----------------------------------------------------------------+
        | GET   /products/myproduct.html?id=5&lang=en#section2   HTTP/1.0 |    Start line 
        +-----------------------------------------------------------------+
        | Host: www.mywebsite.com                                         |    Headers
        | Accept: text/html                                               |
        | Accept-language: en-us                                          |
        | ...                                                             |
        +-----------------------------------------------------------------+
        | E.g. some content (optional body)                               |    Body
        +-----------------------------------------------------------------+

a. Contents of the Start Line in a Request HTTP message:
- Method: A command that tells the Server what to do (e.g. GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) 
  We will see more of this in the 'Additional Information on HTTP and HTTPS' section below.
- Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) (URLs are a subset of URIs!) : A set of readable characters 
  (which specifies the path) and a way to locate the resources we are requesting from the Server.                               
- The HTTP version: specifies the HTTP version so the Server understands the HTTP message
  (e.g. HTTP/0.9, HTTP/1.0, HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, HTTP/3, etc.)

b. Contents of the Header in a Request HTTP message:
- Headers specify some information and rules of the HTTP message. There are a lot of possible 
  headers, but in this example, we will only be looking at 3 headers.
  -> Host - specifies to the address of the Server to which we are sending the Request HTTP message
  -> Accept-Language - specifies the language
  -> Accept - specifies what type of file we are requesting. It holds a Multipurpose Internet Mail 
     Extensions (MIME) data type, which is just a label used to identify a type of data. It typically
     looks has the syntax of: 
            'fileType / extension'
     E.g. 
     => text/html
     => image/gif
     => image/png

c. Contents of the Body in a Request HTTP message:
- Content: Literally any content



Response HTTP message
        +------------------------------------------+
        | HTTP/version         Status code         |    Start line 
        +------------------------------------------+
        | Name1: value1                            |    Headers
        | Name2: value2                            |
        | Name3: value3                            |
        +------------------------------------------+
        | E.g. file requested (optional body)      |    Body
        +------------------------------------------+

E.g.
        +--------------------------------------------+
        | HTTP/1.0  200: OK                          |  Start line
        +--------------------------------------------+
        | Host: www.mywebsite.com                    |  Headers
        | Accept-language: en-us                     |
        | Accept: text/html                          |
        +--------------------------------------------+
        | products/myproduct.html                    |  Body
        +--------------------------------------------+

a. Contents of the Start Line in a Response HTTP message:
- Status Code: This code tells the Client if the Request HTTP message succeeded or failed.
  (e.g. 200: OK, 404: File Not Found etc.) We will see more of this in the 'Additional Information 
  on HTTP and HTTPS' section below.
- The HTTP version: specifies the HTTP version so the Server understands the HTTP message
  (e.g. HTTP/0.9, HTTP/1.0, HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, HTTP/3, etc.)

b. Contents of the Header in a Response HTTP message:
- Headers specify some information and rules of the HTTP message. There are a lot of possible 
  headers, but in this example, we will only be looking at 3 headers.
  -> Host - specifies to the address of the Server to which we are sending the Request HTTP message

     Extensions (MIME) data type, which is just a label used to identify a type of data. It typically
     looks has the syntax of: 
            'fileType / extension'
     E.g. 
     => text/html
     => image/gif
     => image/png

c. Contents of the Body in a Response HTTP message:
- Content: Returns the processed content requested by the Client (e.g. it returns the file that the
  Client requested in the Request HTTP message, which is the 'products/myproduct.html' file in this
  example)

What is Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)? (from the Application Layer)
Nowadays however you would see HTTPS more often instead of HTTP for security reasons.

Additional information on HTTP and HTTPS


What are Request HTTP message methods (aka HTTP verbs)?
Request HTTP message methods are used to indicate the purpose of the Request HTTP message and what 
is expected if the Request HTTP message is successful.

Here are 4 of the most common Request HTTP message methods:
1. POST
2. GET
3. PUT
4. DELETE

which satisfies the CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Destroy), where,
1. Create = POST
2. Read = GET
3. Update = PUT
4. Destroy = DELETE


1. POST - The POST method submits an entity to the specified resource, often causing a change 
          in state or side effects on the Server.
         Request HTTP message Header section syntax:
                  POST     URI     HTTP/version

         Example POST Request HTTP message:
                  POST /test HTTP/1.1
                  Host: example.com
                  Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
                  Content-Length: 27

                  field1=value1&field2=value2

         Example POST Request HTTP message's Response HTTP message:
                  HTTP/1.1 201 Created
                  Content-Type: application/json
                  Date: Sat, 01 Jun 2025 09:30:00 GMT
                  Content-Length: 85
                  Location: /users/12345

                  {
                    "status": "success",
                    "message": "User created successfully.",
                    "userId": "12345"
                  }
                                    

2. GET - The GET method requests a representation of the specified resource.
         Request HTTP message Header section syntax:
                  GET     URI     HTTP/version

         Example GET Request HTTP message:
                  GET /contact HTTP/1.1
                  Host: example.com
                  User-Agent: curl/8.6.0
                  Accept: */*

         Example GET Request HTTP message's Response HTTP message:
                  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
                  Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
                  Date: Fri, 21 Jun 2024 14:18:33 GMT
                  Last-Modified: Thu, 17 Oct 2019 07:18:26 GMT
                  Content-Length: 1234

                  <!doctype html>
                  <!-- HTML content follows -->


3. PUT - The PUT method creates a new resource or replaces a representation of the 
         target resource with the request content.
         Request HTTP message Header section syntax:
                  PUT     URI     HTTP/version

         Example PUT Request HTTP message:
                  PUT /new.html HTTP/1.1
                  Host: example.com
                  Content-type: text/html
                  Content-length: 16

                  <p>New File</p>

         Example PUT Request HTTP message's Response HTTP message:
         -> If no such existing resource, successful resource created 
                  HTTP/1.1 201 Created
                  Date: Sat, 01 Jun 2025 12:00:00 GMT
                  Content-Type: application/json
                  Content-Length: 89

                  Server: ExampleServer/1.0

                  {
                    "status": "created",
                    "message": "The resource has been created successfully.",
                    "path": "/new.html"
                  }

         -> Existing resource found, successfully updated 
                  (No Body by default with 204: No Content Status Code)
                  HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
                  Date: Sat, 01 Jun 2025 12:01:00 GMT
                  Content-Location: /existing.html
                  Server: ExampleServer/1.0

                  OR

What are Response HTTP message Status Codes?
Response HTTP message Status Codes indicate whether a specific Request HTTP message has
been successfully completed or not.

Response HTTP message Status Codes are grouped in 5 classes:
1. Informational responses (100 – 199)
2. Successful responses (200 – 299)
3. Redirection messages (300 – 399)
4. Client error responses (400 – 499)
5. Server error responses (500 – 599)


Here are some of the most common Status Codes are their meaning from each class:
1. Informational responses (100 – 199)
   a. 100 Continue - This interim response indicates that the client should continue the 
      request or ignore the response if the request is already finished.
   b. 101 Switching Protocols - This code is sent in response to an Upgrade request 
      header from the client and indicates the protocol the server is switching to.


2. Successful responses (200 – 299)
   a. 200 OK - The request succeeded. The result and meaning of "success" varies on 
      the Request HTTP message method.
   b. 201 Created - The request succeeded, and a new resource was created as a result. 
      This is typically the response sent after POST requests, or some PUT requests.
   c. 204 No Content - There is no content to send for this request, but the headers 
      are useful. The user agent may update its cached headers for this resource with 
      the new ones.


3. Redirection messages (300 - 399)
   a. 301 Moved Permanently - The URL of the requested resource has been changed 
      permanently. The new URL is given in the response.
   b. 302 Found - This response code means that the URI of requested resource has been 
      changed temporarily. Further changes in the URI might be made in the future, 
      so the same URI should be used by the client in future requests.
   c. 304 Not Modified - This is used for caching purposes. It tells the client that 
      the response has not been modified, so the client can continue to use the same 
      cached version of the response.


4. Client error responses (400 - 499)
   a. 400 Bad Request - The server cannot or will not process the request due to 
      something that is perceived to be a client error (e.g., malformed request 
      syntax, invalid request message framing, or deceptive request routing).
   b. 401 Unauthorized - Although the HTTP standard specifies "unauthorized", 
      semantically this response means "unauthenticated". That is, the client 
      must authenticate itself to get the requested response.
   c. 403 Forbidden - The client does not have access rights to the content; that 
      is, it is unauthorized, so the server is refusing to give the requested 
      resource. Unlike 401 Unauthorized, the client's identity is known to the server.
   d. 404 Not Found - The server cannot find the requested resource. In the browser, 
      this means the URL is not recognized. In an API, this can also mean that 
      the endpoint is valid but the resource itself does not exist. Servers may 
      also send this response instead of 403 Forbidden to hide the existence of a 
      resource from an unauthorized client. This response code is probably the most 
      well known due to its frequent occurrence on the web.


5. Server error responses (500 - 599)
   a. 500 Internal Server Error - The server has encountered a situation it does not 
      know how to handle. This error is generic, indicating that the server cannot 
      find a more appropriate 5XX status code to respond with.
   b. 502 Bad Gateway - This error response means that the server, while working as a 
      gateway to get a response needed to handle the request, got an invalid response.
   c. 504 Gateway Timeout - This error response is given when the server is acting as a 
      gateway and cannot get a response in time.
