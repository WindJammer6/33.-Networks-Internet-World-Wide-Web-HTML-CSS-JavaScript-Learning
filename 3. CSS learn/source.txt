I was too lazy to sit through many hours trying to learn about CSS
programming language.

Hence the '1. demonstration_CSS_styling.css' file is created
using ChatGPT to demonstrate CSS programming language fundamentals.

The '1.1. demonstration_HTML_website.html' file is the same as the
'1. demonstration_HTML_website.html' file in the '2. HTML learn' 
folder.
