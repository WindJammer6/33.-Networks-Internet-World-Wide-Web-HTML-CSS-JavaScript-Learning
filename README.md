I wanted to officially learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript programming languages, but I quickly found myself feeling like I am missing some prerequisite knowledge as I tried to develop more complex front-end and back-end web applications with them.

Turns out what I was missing was about the general understanding about Networks. Since HTML, CSS and JavaScript are programming languages for the World Wide Web, and the World Wide Web is an application on top of the Internet, which is made up of
Networks, I found it helpful to get some general understanding about Networks, the Internet and the World Wide Web, before diving into learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript programming languages.

This folder contains all the MySQL (SQL implementation) files during my SQL programming language with MySQL (SQL implementation) learning journey segregated into 3 folders, '[2. MySQL (SQL implementation) basic syntax](https://github.com/WindJammer6/23.-SQL-learn-with-MySQL-SQL-implementation-/tree/main/SQL%20learn%20with%20My%20SQL%20(SQL%20implementation)%20code%20archives/2.%20MySQL%20(SQL%20implementation)%20basic%20syntax)', '[3. MySQL (SQL implementation) modifying Relational Databases](https://github.com/WindJammer6/23.-SQL-learn-with-MySQL-SQL-implementation-/tree/main/SQL%20learn%20with%20My%20SQL%20(SQL%20implementation)%20code%20archives/3.%20MySQL%20(SQL%20implementation)%20modifying%20Relational%20Databases)' and '[4. MySQL (SQL implementation) integrated with Python (as backend) using PyMySQL (Python library)](https://github.com/WindJammer6/23.-SQL-learn-with-MySQL-SQL-implementation-/tree/main/SQL%20learn%20with%20My%20SQL%20(SQL%20implementation)%20code%20archives/4.%20MySQL%20(SQL%20implementation)%20integrated%20with%20Python%20(as%20backend)%20using%20PyMySQL%20(Python%20library))', organised based on the programming concept of each MySQL (SQL implementation) file. Most of the information from the first and second folders, '[2. MySQL (SQL implementation) basic syntax](https://github.com/WindJammer6/23.-SQL-learn-with-MySQL-SQL-implementation-/tree/main/SQL%20learn%20with%20My%20SQL%20(SQL%20implementation)%20code%20archives/2.%20MySQL%20(SQL%20implementation)%20basic%20syntax)' and '[3.

While in all 3 folders I split the respective lessons myself to the individual folders.

This folder also contains 1 text files, ['1. About_these_MySQL_(SQL_implentation)_tutorials.txt' text file](https://github.com/WindJammer6/23.-SQL-learn-with-MySQL-SQL-implementation-/blob/main/SQL%20learn%20with%20My%20SQL%20(SQL%20implementation)%20code%20archives/1.%20About_these_MySQL_(SQL_implentation)_tutorials.txt), 1 MySQL (SQL implementation) file, ['MySQL_(SQL_implementation)_query_that_creates_the_movies_relational_database_in_a_MySQL_(SQL_implementation)_server.sql' SQL file](https://github.com/WindJammer6/23.-SQL-learn-with-MySQL-SQL-implementation-/blob/main/SQL%20learn%20with%20My%20SQL%20(SQL%20implementation)%20code%20archives/MySQL_(SQL_implementation)_query_that_creates_the_movies_relational_database_in_a_MySQL_(SQL_implementation)_server.sql), and 1 Microsoft Excel file, ['movies_relational_database_visual_in_Microsoft_Excel.xlsx' Microsoft Excel file](https://github.com/WindJammer6/23.-SQL-learn-with-MySQL-SQL-implementation-/blob/main/SQL%20learn%20with%20My%20SQL%20(SQL%20implementation)%20code%20archives/movies_relational_database_visual_in_Microsoft_Excel.xlsx).

<br>

However, I did have some deviation for these tutorial folders from their sources:  

For deviation for the first and second tutorial folders from the Youtube playlist by Quentin Watt Tutorials, titled 'MySQL for Beginners':  
- In the Youtube playlist by Quentin Watt Tutorials, titled 'MySQL for Beginners' used MAMP and PHP as the
  IDE, but I used VScode instead (refer to the file 'Setting_up_MySQL_(SQL_implementation)_in_VScode.txt' for how to set 
  up MySQL with VScode).
- In the Youtube playlist by Quentin Watt Tutorials, titled 'MySQL for Beginners' used a pre-made Relational Database by 
  Quentin, but I used a 'moviesdb' Relational Database provided by codebasics in their Youtube video, titled 'SQL Tutorial 
  for Beginners | MySQL Tutorial' (link: https://youtu.be/Rm0xH2Vpfi0?si=QVr3mUdqUGLHN84R)

For deviation for the third tutorial folder from the Youtube videos by Tech with Tim, titled 'Python MySQL Tutorial - Setup & Basic Queries (w/ MySQL Connector)' and 'Python MySQL Tutorial - Creating Tables, Inserting & Selecting':  
- In these Youtube videos by Tech with Tim, titled 'Python MySQL Tutorial - Setup & Basic Queries (w/ MySQL Connector)' and 'Python MySQL Tutorial - Creating Tables, Inserting & Selecting' used 
  the 'mysql.connector' (Python library), but it dosen't work for my computer for some reason so I used the PyMySQL (Python library) instead, which works for my computer and is relatively 
  similar to the 'mysql.connector' (Python library) in functionality and syntax.

*How to use the MySQL (SQL implementation) files in this folder?*  
The MySQL (SQL implementation) files in this folder can only be used after setting up VS code, where instructions can be found from the '[3.

'How_to_set_up_a_Relational_Database_in_an_empty_MySQL_(SQL implementation)_server_and_how_to_run_MySQL_(SQL_implementation)_queries_in_VScode.txt' text file](https://github.com/WindJammer6/23.-SQL-learn-with-MySQL-SQL-implementation-/blob/main/How_to_set_up_a_Relational_Database_in_an_empty_MySQL_(SQL%20implementation)_server_and_how_to_run_MySQL_(SQL_implementation)_queries_in_VScode)'.
